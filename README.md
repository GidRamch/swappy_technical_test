# Swappy Technical test

Note on AI usage:

Except for the problems folder, AI tools are allowed, but do not submit fully generated code — only use them for autocomplete or occasional guidance.

If AI was used for any of the technical tests, please include an AI.md file explaining which tool was used and how it helped.

Don’t spend too much time on the tests. If you cannot finish, simply explain why and which problem blocked you.

Commit after each problem, even if it’s incomplete or unsuccessful — the goal is to see your problem-solving process.

Comment your code where needed, especially where a problem was solved.
